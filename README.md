Physics project for my college! Its about Wheatstone bridge calculation of unknown resistance.  Using tkinter
Hello! 
I have some physics project for my college! Its about Wheatstone bridge calculation of unknown resistance. 
Using tkinter I had made that program! User type - in 2 resistors values (R1 and R2), have one variable resistor R3 (that uses slider), Rx is unknown resistor. 
User uses slider for resistor R3 to balance the bridge! I have also value Vd (voltage difference) that need to change as I move R3 slider so when Vd reaches zero or near zero I can read the Rx value and that shows exact value of unknown resistor! I also have Vs (voltage source) for the calculations!
My main problem is: Vd stays zero always, moving slider R3 doesnt change it, but that is not how is it supposed to work right!?

If someone have time and will, I would appreciate it because its pretty important to me! We can talk in dm or by mail. I can share code for You so You can have more detailed insight!

Thank you everyone that help!
